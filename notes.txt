what data structure would you use for BFS and DFS?
A graph (tree could be valid answer since tree is a type of graph)

Steps for DFS on a graph 

Start at first vertex 
put in stack 
vist neighbors in abc order 
for each neighbor: 
put vertex in stack 
visit neighbor process continues 
only put unvisited things in stack
